# Triatomic
Contains MCCC structure code for a triatomic, planar molecule such as H3+. This is part of a project to 
generalise the molecule convergent close-coupling (MCCC) method to non-linear molecules. The
first step in such a project is to develop an MCCC code for a triatomic molecule, the simplest 
of which is H3+.

At present, this repository contains a structure code for both H3++, a single electron system and its two electron
generalisation H3+. The two electron structure code uses the H3++ single electron states as a basis for a configuration interaction (CI)
calculation, at present using the frozen core (FC) approximation.
