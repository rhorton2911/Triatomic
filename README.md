# Triatomic
Contains MCCC structure code for a triatomic, planar molecule such as H3+. This is part of a project to 
generalise the molecule convergent close-coupling (MCCC) method to non-linear molecules. The
first step in such a project is to develop an MCCC code for a triatomic molecule, the simplest 
of which is H3+.

At present, this repository contains a structure code for H3++, a single electron system. Once
this code has been completed and thoroughly tested, it will be generalised to perform a full CI
calculation for H3+, using the H3++ single electron states generated as a basis.
